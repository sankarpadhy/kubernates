# Learn Kubernetes Step by Step

This repository contains a structured approach to learning Kubernetes using Docker, without requiring local Kubernetes installation. Each directory contains practical examples and hands-on exercises.

## Learning Path Overview

### Foundation (Week 1)
1. **01-kubernetes-architecture/**
   - Understanding Kubernetes Components
   - Control Plane Architecture
   - Worker Node Components
   - API Server and etcd
   - Scheduler and Controller Manager

2. **02-basic-resources/**
   - Pods and Containers
   - ReplicaSets and Deployments
   - Services and Networking Basics
   - ConfigMaps and Secrets
   - Resource Management

### Intermediate (Week 2)
3. **03-cluster-administration/**
   - Cluster Setup and Management
   - Networking Configurations
   - Storage Management
   - Security and RBAC
   - Resource Quotas and Limits

4. **04-real-world-scenarios/**
   - Multi-tier Application Deployment
   - High Availability Patterns
   - Service Mesh Integration
   - CI/CD Pipeline Setup

### Hands-on Exercises (Throughout)
- **Exercise 1**: Pod Basics
- **Exercise 2**: Controllers and Deployments
- **Exercise 3**: Services and Networking
- **Exercise 4**: Storage and Configuration
- **Exercise 5**: Security Implementation
- **Exercise 6**: Monitoring and Logging
- **Exercise 7**: Scaling and High Availability

## Interactive Learning Guides

To make learning Kubernetes more engaging and hands-on, we've created interactive visualizations:

1. **Kubernetes Architecture Explorer** (`interactive-guides/index.html`)
   - Interactive component visualization
   - Live command simulation
   - Component relationship demonstrations
   - Hands-on exercises

2. **Pod Networking Simulator** (`interactive-guides/pod-networking.html`)
   - Visual pod-to-pod communication
   - Service networking demonstration
   - Real-time traffic simulation
   - Network policy visualization

To use these guides:
1. Open the HTML files in your browser
2. Click on components to see detailed information
3. Try the interactive exercises
4. Experiment with different networking scenarios
